Here are some of the bands I am in or have been in, their releases, and any other things relating to my life as a musician.

Loud faux J-rock band I am in. Nothing released yet, but we plan on doing so in late 2024 or early 2025.

#### Show Posters

Here's a look at our previous show posters (because I think they're cool):

Indie rock band featuring myself, 2 of my closest high school friends, and an amazing singer I met on Craigslist who shares a love for Built to Spill and the Archers of Loaf.

We wrote and recorded several songs between the fall of 2021 and the spring of 2022. I finally mixed and released an EP of the best of those songs on November 8th, 2024.
